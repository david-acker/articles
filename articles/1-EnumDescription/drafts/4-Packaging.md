# NuGet Packaging

If you've created your Roslyn tools for internal use or wish to share them with the community, packaging them as a NuGet package is a great idea. Here's a step-by-step guide to doing that:

1. **NuGet Configuration**: Right-click your project > Add > New Item > Select "NuGet Configuration File". This will add a `.nuspec` file.

2. **Edit Nuspec**: Update the `.nuspec` file with relevant metadata:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <package xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd">
       <metadata>
           <id>YourRoslynTools</id>
           <version>1.0.0</version>
           <authors>YourName</authors>
           <description>Roslyn tools for enum descriptions.</description>
       </metadata>
       <files>
           <file src="bin\Release\YourProject.dll" target="tools" />
           <file src="bin\Release\Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.dll" target="tools" />
           <!-- Include other dependencies as required -->
       </files>
   </package>
   ```

3. **Create the Package**: Open a command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run:

   ```
   nuget pack YourProject.csproj
   ```

   This will generate a `.nupkg` file.

4. **Publishing**: If you wish to share your package with others, you can publish it to [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/). Simply create an account, and use the "Upload Package" option.
